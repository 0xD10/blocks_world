# blocks_world
An exercise for my A.I. class, implementing dfs, bfs, a* and best search algorithms for solving the blocks world problem.
# Execution
```bash
./bw.py <algorithm> <input_file> <output_file>
``` 
- algorithm option can be `depth` | `breadth` | `astar` | `best`
- choose a problem from input_file directory
- declare the name of the output file name
